Traditionally, web browsers have limited access to the networking stack on the host computer. 
This project aims at providing a simple JavaScript API to facilitate secure access to network 
transports such as UDP, TCP and peer-to-peer connectivity to the web applications from within 
a browser. The easy to use JavaScript API will allow web applications to build complex real-time 
communication, video streaming and conferencing applications without relying on any support 
from the servers.
